# Predicting-the-Active-Power-of-a-wind-turbine

With the proliferation of wind farms, there is an increasing need for accurate forecasting models to estimate the active energy generated by the turbines. The main objective of this report is to develop a suitable machine learning model capable of predicting the active power generated by a wind turbine. More specifically, it will attempt to identify the most important variables among the 22 features of the dataset in terms of their influence on active power. The data is labelled and the different models will be trained in a supervised environment and subjected to the same test set to allow comparison. The second objective is to gain insights into which measurements are most important for energy forecasts. It also investigates the tradeoff between the number of sensors and the added explanatory power to the model.
